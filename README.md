# KOI-x

> *Quiet experimentation. Bricks, not boasts.*

Welcome to a space in progress.  
This account is a notebook. A sandbox.  
A place where ideas try to walk.

I’m not a developer by trade.  
I’m not a coder by expertise.  
But I’m learning — line by line, bug by bug.

### 📌 What you’ll find here
- Scripts that work (sometimes).
- Systems that break (often).
- Efforts to understand what I’m building.

This is not about polish.  
It’s about **open construction**.  
Following the ethos of those who built things that outlived them.

### 🌱 Philosophy
- Build publicly  
- Document mistakes  
- Stay kind, stay curious  
- Don’t fake knowledge  
- Give credit  
- Respect the unknown
